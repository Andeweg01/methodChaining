# methodChaining
Challenge 1 in method chaining

write jQuery in script.js file and add CSS to the style.css file to make the following changes to the blue button in the button.html file. Apply the following behavior to the blue button in the button.html file:

Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a red color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in the html).
Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.
On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.
On mouseleave reverse the above.
Use method chaining to achieve the above.
